# Red Team vs Blue Team project
As the Red Team, I attacked a vulnerable VM within the environment, ultimately gaining root access to the machine. As Blue Team, I used Kibana to review logs taken during the first engagement. I used the logs to extract hard data and visualizations for my report.
Then, I interpreted the log data to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit that I successfully performed.

In this project I applied my knowledge of the following skills and tools:


* Penetration testing with Kali Linux.


* Log and incident analysis with Kibana.


* System hardening and configuration.


* Reporting, documentation, and communication.
